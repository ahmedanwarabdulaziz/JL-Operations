# JL Operations Website Structure

## Overview
The application has been restructured into a professional website with two main areas:

### 1. Public Website (`/`)
- **Home Page**: Professional landing page with hero section, services, and call-to-action
- **Header**: Navigation with links to Services, About, Contact, and Admin Login
- **Footer**: Company information, quick links, and contact details
- **SEO Optimized**: Clean URLs and professional structure

### 2. Admin Panel (`/admin`)
- **Protected Area**: Requires authentication
- **All Management Features**: Dashboard, Orders, Customers, Workshop, etc.
- **Professional Interface**: Clean separation from public content
