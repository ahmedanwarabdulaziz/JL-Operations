##### Issue D: Gmail API Quotas
**Symptoms:**

##### Step 1: Test Gmail Authorization
1. Go to `/admin/email-test`
2. Check Gmail Configuration status
3. If not configured, click "Authorize Gmail"
4. Use "Test Auth" button to verify

##### Step 2: Test Email Sending
1. Enter a test email address (use your own email for testing)
2. Fill in test data:
   - Customer Name: "Test Customer"
   - Order Number: "TEST-001"
   - Treatments: "Leather Treatment, Fabric Protection"
3. Toggle "Include Review Request" as needed

#### 5. **Debug Information to Collect**

When reporting issues, please provide:

1. **Console Logs:**
   ```
   Copy all console messages starting with üîç or üß™
   ```

2. **Gmail Configuration Status:**
   ```
   - Is Gmail configured? (Yes/No)
   - User Email: [email address]
   - Token Status: [Set/Not Set]
   ```

3. **Order Information:**
   ```
   - Customer Email: [email address]

   - Has Treatments: (Yes/No)
   - Treatments: [list of treatments]
   ```

4. **Error Messages:**
   ```
   Copy any error messages from console or UI
   ```

#### 6. **Fallback Behavior**

The system has a fallback mechanism:
- If Gmail API fails, it shows "simulation completed"
- This means the email wasn't actually sent
- Check the console for the actual error

#### 7. **Verification Steps**

To verify if an email was actually sent:

1. **Check Gmail Sent Folder:**
   - Look in the Gmail account used for sending
   - Check "Sent" folder for the email

2. **Check Spam/Junk Folder:**
   - Recipient should check spam/junk folder
   - Add sender to contacts if needed

3. **Check Gmail API Response:**
   - Console should show "‚úÖ Gmail API response"
   - Should include `messageId` and `threadId`

#### 8. **Quick Fixes**

##### If emails are going to simulation:
1. Re-authorize Gmail in `/admin/email-settings`
2. Check Gmail API quotas
3. Verify network connectivity

##### If no emails are being sent at all:
1. Check if customer has email address
2. Verify "Send completion email" is checked in dialog
3. Check console for error messages

##### If emails are sent but not received:
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify email address is correct
3. Check Gmail API response in console

### üö® Emergency Contact

If you continue to have issues:
1. Collect all debug information above
2. Check the console logs thoroughly
3. Test with the Email Test Page first
4. Report specific error messages and console output
